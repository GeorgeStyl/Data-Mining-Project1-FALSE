# A group project of our University's course 'Data Mining', focused on building a lyrics search engine using Apache Lucene. The application includes a JavaFX-based graphical user interface with integrated web scraping functionality. For compatibility reasons (Apache Lucene), Java was used throughout the project. The dataset consists of 25,000 songs scraped from the A-Z Lyrics website.

## About This Project

This repository contains the implementation of FALSE (Finally! Another Lyrics Search Engine), a group project developed as part of the university course Data Mining.

The goal of this project is to build a search engine capable of storing, indexing, and retrieving songs — including their titles, artists, lyrics, and metadata — using the Apache Lucene library. Lucene is a widely-used open-source library that supports core Information Retrieval functionalities such as text indexing, Boolean and Vector Space search models, phrase queries, and relevance ranking.

Our search engine is based on a dataset of 25,000 songs, which were collected through web scraping from the website A-Z Lyrics. To facilitate user interaction, we also developed a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX, which includes integrated web scraping functionality. Java was chosen as the main development language to ensure compatibility with the Lucene library.

The project demonstrates the application of core data mining principles in combination with real-world technologies such as text indexing, information retrieval models, and web data extraction.
